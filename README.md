# TrendingRepositoriesGitHub
App of the latest trending repositories on GitHub 

* The app is preforming a list of the latest repositories for a three different periods of timeline last day, last week and last month.

* The user can add the shown output of repositories to a favorite list, and save it localy.

* The app uses the MVC architecture - I prefered this architecture instead of the MVVM architecture, because I'm more familliar with the MVC and I wanted to preform you my best.

* In this app I used *only iOS framworks* again to show my ability and knowladge of handling the basic and built in iOS frameworks.

* For better preformence of the app "No internet connection" indication, and for cleaner code for the network calls, I whould have use a third party library - "AlamoFire", they have a easy way of implementaition the indication of "No internt" and it look much better then the alert indication I used for the app.

* For saving the favorite list data I used the UserDeufault.Standart because the amount of data save is not to big, if the app would become bigger or need to save more large data I would use CoreData.

* - If i had more time to spent for this task i would have build the search bar with "UISearchBarViewController" with filtering the result of the search. 
  - Same for the implementation of downloading the url to the app, I would create a field with the name of the url combined with the name of the repo and that will be uniqe for the actual url, when a request get loaded the new field will cache the details fetched from the local save and will display it instead of using redownloading the url.
  
* I would like to say that I really enjoyed working and building the app, I also learned new thing about fetching the right RestApi, that needed more thinking of my side for how to get it.

Hope you will enjoy the app.
