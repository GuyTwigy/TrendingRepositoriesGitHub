# TrendingRepositoriesGitHub
App of the latest trending repositories on GitHub 

* The app is performing a list of the latest repositories for three different periods of timeline last day, last week, and last month.

* The user can add the shown output of repositories to a favorite list, and save it locally.

* The app uses the MVC architecture - I preferred this architecture instead of the MVVM architecture, because I'm more familiar with the MVC and I wanted to preform my best.

* In this app, I used *only iOS frameworks* again to show my ability and knowledge of handling the basic and built in iOS frameworks.

* For better performance of the app "No internet connection" indication, and for cleaner code for the network calls, I would have use a third-party library - "AlamoFire", they have an easy way of implementing the indication of "No internet" and it looks much better than the alert indication I used for the app.

* For saving the favorite list data I used the UserDeufault.Standart because the amount of data save is not too big, if the app would become bigger or need to save more large data I would use CoreData.

* - If I had more time to spend on this task I would have built the search bar with "UISearchBarViewController" by filtering the result of the search. 
  - Same for the implementation of downloading the url to the app, I would create a field with the name of the url combined with the name of the repo and that will be unique for the actual url, when a request gets loaded the new field will cache the details fetched from the local save and will display it instead of using redownloading the url.
  
* I would like to say that I really enjoyed working and building the app, I also learned a new thing about fetching the right RestApi, which needed more thinking on my side for how to get it.

Hope you will enjoy the app.
Guy Twig.
